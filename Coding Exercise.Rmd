```{r}
source("setup.R")
```

```{r}
data("knz_bison")

glimpse(knz_bison)
```

1. Create a new column in the bison dataset that calculates the individualâ€™s age at the time of observation.
```{r}
bison_age <- knz_bison %>% 
  mutate("age" = (rec_year - animal_yob))
```

2. Write a function that will first filter the bison dataset based on any user-specified weight threshold (returning the filtered dataset).
```{r}
knz_bison %>% 
  filter(animal_weight == 890)

filter_weight <- function(x) {
  knz_bison %>% 
    filter(animal_weight == x)
}
```

3. Create a boxplot showing weight distribution between male and female bison, and then conduct a t-test to see if weight is significantly difference between males and females.
```{r}
knz_bison %>% 
  drop_na()
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = animal_weight)) +
  facet_wrap(~animal_sex)
```
